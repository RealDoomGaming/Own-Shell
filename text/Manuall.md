# Shell Manuall

### Basic Usage:

If you really really want to use this shell (I dont know why any person would ever want to do that) you need to know the basic syntax and stuff since my shell is a bit, lets say, different.
So you might ask how it is different well I will explain:  When you want to use a command you need to first type in the command, then the parameters and then the other things the command needs.

For example with echo it would be like:
1. $> echo 
2. $> echo (options)
3. $> echo (options) (output)

It takes some time to get used to but since I am making this shell for practise this system makes it a lot easier to code the shell.

Now since you know the basic usage and syntax of my shell we can move on to the commands:

### Commands:

#### echo:
Does like the normal things the echo commands would do:
Displays text on the terminal!!

Options:
- n: places a \n at the end of the text you want to print 


#### ls:

#### cd:

#### rm:

#### read:

#### clear:

#### mkdir:
